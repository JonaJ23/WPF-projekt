First group project in school where we made a Netflix type of app where you are able to create an account that gets saved in a SQL database and get access
to a database of 40.000 movies from an API. You can order these movies through the application.  

Technologies/frameworks/packages used:
C#, .NET core, WPF, MaterialDesign, SQL.


Example of MainWindow with the movie database:
